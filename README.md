## Details

Built in 24hrs (including 12hrs for PulseTest 1.0).

Improvements from 1.0: Sweet UI/UX, smoothing algorithm for better detection accuracy, cleaner code, smaller app size... just generally more badass.

The app uses AVFoundation for playing with the camera, and Parse for the login and user data back-end.
